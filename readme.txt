This project contains all sources for the German XML Security Tools tutorials on www.xml-sicherheit.de/tutorials. All text is contained in XML files, which are aggregated and transformed via XSLT into HTML files.

The XML transformation is done with Saxon-HE 9.3.05 (http://saxon.sourceforge.net). All builds are done via the build.xml configuration.


The XML Security Tools documentation uses "The Saxon XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited"
to transform the XML documents into various HTML help files. This processor is distributed under the
